# Movies-recommender-system
This repository contains code for building a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering with the MovieLens 100K dataset. The recommender system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings and item similarities. 

Key Features:
- Loading and preprocessing the MovieLens 100K dataset
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization of movie ratings
- Calculation of item-item and user-user similarity matrices
- Prediction of user ratings using collaborative filtering
- Evaluation of the recommender system using root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Implementation of singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction
- Calculation of SVD-based predictions and evaluation using RMSE

Requirements:
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy

Usage:
1. Download the MovieLens 100K dataset and place it in the repository directory.
2. Install the required dependencies 
3. Run the code to build and evaluate the movie recommender system using collaborative filtering and SVD-based predictions.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different collaborative filtering techniques, evaluation metrics, and dataset preprocessing steps. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
